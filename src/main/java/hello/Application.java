/**
 * http://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/#_create_an_application_class
 *
 * The @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds the following:
 *  - @Configuration tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
 *  - @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans,
 *    and various property settings.
 *  - Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it
 *    sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key
 *    behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
 *  - @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package,
 *    allowing it to find the HelloController.
 *
 *  Run the application:
 *  1) ./gradlew build
 *  2) java -jar build/libs/spring-boot-sample-0.1.0.jar
 *
 *  Check out the service:
 *  localhost:8080
